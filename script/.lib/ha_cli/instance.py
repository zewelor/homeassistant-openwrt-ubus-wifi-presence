"""Whether Home Assistant is running locally, and since when.

The development instance is shared: the developer starts, stops, and restarts it
while an agent is working, and the agent does the same. Neither side may assume
its own last action still holds. This answers the question authoritatively and
cheaply, so nobody has to go digging through `ps` output.

`homeassistant/runner.py` holds an exclusive `flock` on `.ha_run.lock` for as
long as it runs, and deliberately never unlinks the file — so the file existing
proves nothing, and only the lock does. The contents are what the last run wrote
at startup, and are current only while that lock is held.
