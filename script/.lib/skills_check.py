"""
Validate the agent skills under .agents/skills/.

Checks conformance with the Agent Skills open standard (https://agentskills.io/specification)
plus the conventions this repository adds on top of it:

- frontmatter parses and only uses spec-defined fields
- ``name`` matches the directory and the spec's naming rules
- ``description`` is present and within the 1024 character limit
- SKILL.md body stays within the recommended 500 lines
- reference files sit exactly one level below SKILL.md
- relative markdown links resolve, in the skills and in every file that points into them
- every skill is listed in the catalogues that template sync can update
- no concrete project identifiers leak in (they must stay template-sync safe)
- the marker blocks initialize.sh strips or rewrites are intact

Invoked by script/skills-check; not intended to be run directly.
